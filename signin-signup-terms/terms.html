      <h2>A. Definitions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>        1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the XLSweep Privacy Policy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.

        </li>

</ol>
<h2>B. Account Terms</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>1. Required Information</h3>
    You must provide a valid email address, password & user name in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</li>
<li><h3>2. Account Requirements</h3>
    We have a few simple rules for accounts on XLSweep's Service.
    <ul>
       <li>• You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:</li>
       <li>        • A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.
    </li>
       <li>        • One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
    </li> 

       <li>       • You must be age 13 or older. XLSweep does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
    </li> 
  </ul>
      
<li></li>
<li><h3>3. User Account Security</h3>
You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service.
<ul><li>  • You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account.
</li>
    <li>  • You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. XLSweep cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
</li>
    <li>  • You will promptly notify XLSweep if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.
</li>
</ul></li></ol>

You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from XLSweep, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from XLSweep or XLSweep Users.
